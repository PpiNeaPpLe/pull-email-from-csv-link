ChIJZZVW5nvJD4gRr4LxXDqQhE4,A Custom Services Inc,"""From Backyard Engineer to Chicago's HVAC Expert""

It started with a lawn mower engine and a dream. As a kid in Chicago's Albany Park, Tom Hack wasn't just playing sports – he was building go-carts, fixing bikes, and discovering his calling one repair at a time. This natural talent for solving mechanical puzzles led him to E.T.I. trade school, where his HVAC journey began.

By 1988, Tom was transforming Chicago's finest North Shore homes with custom AC installations. Each project presented unique challenges in these lakeside residences, demanding creative solutions that would become his trademark. Within nine months, his exceptional work earned him a lead installer position.
